# Useless GPT

Useless GPT is a playful and humorous web application that generates completely nonsensical and absurd responses to user questions. Built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express** for the backend, this application leverages **Google's Gemini API** to provide answers that are intentionally unhelpful and confusing. Whether you're looking for a good laugh or just want to explore the quirky side of AI, Useless GPT is here to entertain!
